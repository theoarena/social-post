### 🚀 Launching on Vercel: Step-by-Step

1. **Database Provisioning**: Create a new Postgres database (via completely free tiers on Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Neon). Retrieve the pooling connection string (`DATABASE_URL`) and direct connection string (`DIRECT_URL`).
2. **Project Creation**: Import your GitHub fork into the Vercel dashboard.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Copy the variables above into the Vercel project settings environment tab.
4. **Deploy**: Hit "Deploy". Vercel will automatically run the build steps (`npm run build`).
5. **Database Push**: Since Prisma does not automatically migrate via Vercel builds by default, you may want to append `npx prisma db push && ` to your Vercel build command, or manually run it locally pointing to your production database URL.
6. **Integrations Setup**:
   - Establish a **Google Cloud OAuth app**, enabling the callback URL: `https://social-post-woad.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Setup a **Stripe Webhook**, pointing to `https://social-post-woad.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook` and selecting the `checkout.session.completed` event to grab your webhook signing secret.

## 🛠️ Local Development

Ready to iterate locally? Setup is straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- A local PostgreSQL instance or a free cloud Database URL.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/social-post
cd social-post

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Setup Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and insert your specific keys. You can use a local DB or your dev cloud DB.

# 4. Initialize Database Schema
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# 5. Start the Development Server
npm run dev
```

The graphical console should now be heavily responsive on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Prisma Introspection Cycle)

> ⚠️ **Database Safety Warning**: This application shares a single PostgreSQL database instance on Supabase with other applications in this workspace. Follow the cycle below to synchronize models safely:

1. **Pull all existing tables**: `npx prisma db pull` (introspects all 20+ active tables)
2. **Declare relation changes**: Inject the `SocialPostCreation` model in your local `schema.prisma` and link it inside the `User` model.
3. **Push to database**: Run `npx prisma db push` to merge changes safely.
4. **Local Schema Cleanup**: Strip away other applications' models from your local `schema.prisma`, leaving only `Account`, `Session`, `User`, `VerificationToken`, and `SocialPostCreation`.
5. **Compile local client**: Run `npx prisma generate` to build your local Prisma client.
